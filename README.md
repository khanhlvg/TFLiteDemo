# TFLiteDemo
Sample app and notebook to demo several TensorFlow Lite models. I'll continue adding more models in the future.

## Image Segmentation
![Demo](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/segmentation/images/segmentation.gif "Image Segmentation")
* Model from TF Lite [Model Repository](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/segmentation/overview)
* [Notebook](notebook/Image_Segmentation.ipynb) / [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khanhlvg/TFLiteDemo/blob/master/notebook/Image_Segmentation.ipynb) to show you how to do pre/post processing to use the model 
* Android app ([Implementation](android/app/src/main/java/com/google/examples/cameraml/SegmentationProcessor.kt)) to show you how to integrate the model to an app
